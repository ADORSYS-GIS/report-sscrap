## Documentation on Test Modularity

## overview
This module involves  verifying the individuals components or modules of a system in isolation to ensure that they function correctly and independently.

##  Unit Tests:
- Create unit tests for each module to validate its behavior in isolation.
- Focus on testing a specific functionality of the module with well-defined inputs and expected outputs.
- Avoid any external dependencies to isolate the module being tested.
- Write test cases to cover different scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
- Use an appropriate testing  library to write  and execute the unit tests for example , selenium.
- Verify that the module behaves as expected and produces the correct output for a given input.

## Intergration Testing 
- Identify the interactions and dependencies between different modules in your codebase.
- Devolop intergration tests to validate the baahavior of these modules when intergrated together.
- Test the flow of data and control between modules, ensuring they work smoothly as a whole.
- Use real test data to simulate the actual usage scenarios.
- Verify that the intergrated system produces the expected results and handles error conditions well.

## Adding, Updating, and Removing Modules
- Write tests that specifically focus on the ease of adding,updating and removing modules.
- Test the process of adding a new module to the existing codebase, ensuring it integrates smoothly.
- For updating modules,test that the changes made do not introduce regresssions break existing funtionality.
- Test the removal of a module to ensure that it doesn't cause any adverse effects on the rest of the system.

## Conclusion
In conclusion it is important to folllow best practices for unit and integration testing in your specific development enviroment to ensure effecive and reliable test analysis.
