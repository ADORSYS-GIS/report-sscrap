When it comes to modularizing code for web scraping there are several approaches you can take to ensure clean codes. Here are some suggestions:
# Separate modules:
divide your code into logical modules based on their specific responsibility for example; beautifulsoup, pandas, flask, selenium, notebook.
# Create utility functions:
create functions in each module to carry out specific task. These functions can then be saved and stored which can then be imported into other modules when needed
# The use of configuration files:
Making use of configuration file such as JSON to make the code more flexible. This allows us to modify our used parameters without modifying the code itself.
# Implementation of error handling:
In handling errors and exceptions gracefully we would make use of the try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions that occur during project. One can take appropriate actions based on the specific task which he carries
# Unittesting:
Write a unit test for each module to ensure that it function correctly and produce the expected results. The unit test also helps catch bugs early enough
