1- This code takes a data file as input.

2- The with open(data_file, 'r') as f: statement opens the file in read mode and stores its content in the file_content variable.

3- The try-except block is used to attempt parsing the file content as JSON. If it fails, it moves on to the next try-except block.

4- Inside the second try-except block, the script attempts to parse the file content as CSV using the csv.DictReader function.

5- If neither JSON nor CSV parsing is successful, a ValueError is raised, indicating that the file format is not supported.

6- The data variable is converted into a pandas DataFrame.

7- The script then displays some basic statistics about the data, such as the total number of websites analyzed, the average character count, and the average image count.

8- The script also generates histograms for the character count and image count, and displays them using the matplotlib.pyplot library.

The code uses nested try-except blocks to handle potential errors during file opening, parsing, and data analysis.
