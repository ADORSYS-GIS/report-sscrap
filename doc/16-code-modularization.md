When it comes to modularizing code for web scraping there are several approaches you can take to ensure clean codes. Here are some suggestions:
# Separate modules:
divide your code into logical modules based on their specific responsibility for example; beautifulsoup, pandas, flask, selenium, notebook.
# Create utility functions:
create functions in each module to carry out specific task. These functions can then be saved and stored which can then be imported into other modules when needed
# The use of configuration files:
Making use of configuration file such as JSON to make the code more flexible. This allows us to modify our used parameters without modifying the code itself.
# Implementation of error handling:
In handling errors and exceptions gracefully we would make use of the try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions that occur during project. One can take appropriate actions based on the specific task which he carries
# Unittesting:
Write a unit test for each module to ensure that it function correctly and produce the expected results. The unit test also helps catch bugs early enough 
in this code 
# file.py
def function1(args1):
    # Some implementation that uses `function2`
    pass

def function2(args2):
    # Some unknown implementation
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    function1("someArgument")
# error found:
When the script is run directly, the function1 is called with the argument "someArgument". However, since function2 is called within function1 but it is defined after function1 in the code, an error will occur. The error will indicate that function2 is not defined.
# provided solution:
To resolve this issue, you can either move the definition of function2 before function1. Here's an example of moving the definition of function2 before function1:
def function2(args2):
    # Some unknown implementation
    pass

def function1(args1):
    # Some implementation that uses `function2`
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    function1("someArgument")
in this script provided function2 is defined before it is used in function1, ensuring that the code will execute without any errors.
