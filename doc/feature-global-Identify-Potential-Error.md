Scraping Project Error Source Identification Documentation

Project name: REPORT SCRAPPY

Date: 01/12/2023

Introduction
This documentation aims to provide an overview of the error source identification process for a scraping project. 
The goal is to analyze each part of the system, including the front_end, back_end, database, and other components,  
to identify potential error sources. The focus will be on identifying network issues, database errors, user input errors, 
and other relevant error sources.

Error Source Identification Process
1. Front_end Analysis
Review the front_end components of the scraping project.
Identify areas where user input is required, such as forms or input fields.
Analyze potential issues related to user input errors, such as invalid input, missing fields, or incorrect data formats.

2. Back_end Analysis
Examine the back_end code responsible for handling the scraping process.
Review the code that makes network requests, retrieves and processes data, and stores it in the database or file system.
Identify potential issues related to backend operations, such as network issues, data processing errors, or data storage issues.

3.Network Issues
The code includes a try-except block to catch network-related errors during URL fetching.
If a network error occurs, the system prints an informative error message.
This logic is applied in sections where network requests are made.

4. Database Issues
The code includes a try-except block around database operations to catch potential errors.
If a database connection error occurs, an error message is printed.
This logic is applied in sections where database operations are performed.
rror Handling Strategies


Develop error handling logic for each identified potential error source.
Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms, such as try-except blocks, to catch and handle errors gracefully.
Customize error messages to provide clear and informative feedback to users or system administrators.
