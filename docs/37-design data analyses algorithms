## designing the data analyses algorithms for the scrapped data

1- Descriiptive analyses which involves the analyses of the scrapped data such as words and images count per url enterred lets demonstrate the algorithm used here

    . we start by verifying if there is data in the analysed file
    . if true then we count the number of words and images in each column of the analysed file
    . then from all the words and images we the obtaind and average of all of them
    . if false that is file being empty we return zero
    
2- Extracting relevant features for clusterring(cluster analyses)
   were we extract relevant features for clusterring such as
   . mean
   . median of the analysed data

3- Data correlation
    . were we analyse the trend of data such average words count versus average image count
