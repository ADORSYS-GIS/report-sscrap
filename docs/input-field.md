## Design an input field that can accept multiple URLs
    Visual Design: Use a text area element, which provides a multi-line input field, to allow users to enter URLs on separate lines.
    Size: Adjust the rows and columns of the text area to provide sufficient space for entering multiple URLs.
    Visual Design: Utilize a specialized input field that supports tags or tokens. Each URL entered by the user will be treated as a separate tag.
    Tag Creation: Enable users to create tags by pressing Enter, comma, or a specific key. This allows users to enter multiple URLs sequentially.
    Tag Removal: Provide a mechanism to remove tags if users make a mistake or want to delete a specific URL.
    Validation: Implement validation logic to ensure that the entered URLs are properly formatted. Display error messages if the URLs are not valid.
    Processing: Define a mechanism to process the entered URLs, similar to the text area approach.
